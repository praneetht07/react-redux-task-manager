## About The App

Tax Manager is an app that enables you to manage your taxes. There are two Widgets in the App. A Summary Widget to track a summary of the customerâ€™s financial status. Invoices Widget to manage the list of invoices the user has for his/her customers, which supports both editing existing invoices as well as creating new ones.

## Technologies

I used React for the UI and Redux Toolkit for managing the state of the application. I used [framer-motion](#https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) for animation. I used [miragejs](#https://www.npmjs.com/package/miragejs) for mocking the API response.

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to start the app

## Approach

I adopted SCSS for styling the app
