## About The App

Task manager is an app that enables you to manage your tasks. All the pending tasks are shown in red and all the completed tasks are shown in green. All the tasks are sorted based on status completed first and creation date newest first. Tasks can be filtered based on the status pending and completed. New tasks can be added by clicking new task button. The status of the tasks can be changed by toggling the checkbox.

## Technologies

I used React for the UI and Redux Toolkit for managing the state of the application. I used [framer-motion](#https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) for animation.

## Setup
